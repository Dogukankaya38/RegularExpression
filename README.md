# Regular Expressions Overview

This project includes examples of various regular expressions and their purposes. Each regular expression is designed to match specific patterns in strings. Below is a detailed explanation of each regular expression:

## Regular Expressions

### 1. `(aba*)(abb*)(a*b)*`
- **Description**: This regular expression matches strings that follow a specific pattern:
  - Starts with the character `a`.
  - Followed by zero or more occurrences of the character `b`.
  - Followed by another `a`.
  - Followed by zero or more occurrences of the character `b`.
  - Ends with zero or more repetitions of `a` followed by zero or more `b`s.
- **Examples**: 
  - `a`
  - `ab`
  - `abbb`
  - `aabb`
  - `abaaa`

### 2. `k[(bd)+(bbd)+(bbbddd)]*t`
- **Description**: This regular expression matches strings that adhere to the following pattern:
  - Starts with the character `k`.
  - Followed by zero or more occurrences of:
    - `bd`
    - `bbd`
    - `bbbddd`
  - Ends with the character `t`.
- **Examples**: 
  - `kbt`
  - `kbbdbt`
  - `kbbdtt`
  - `kbbbdddt`

### 3. `(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)`
- **Description**: This regular expression matches strings consisting of exactly three characters where each character is either `a` or `b`.
- **Examples**: 
  - `aaa`
  - `aab`
  - `aba`
  - `abb`
  - `baa`
  - `bab`
  - `bba`
  - `bbb`

### 4. `(0+1)(0+1)(0+1)(0+1)(0+1)*`
- **Description**: This regular expression matches strings that:
  - Start with exactly five characters, each being either `0` or `1`.
  - Are followed by zero or more additional characters that are either `0` or `1`.
- **Examples**: 
  - `00000`
  - `01101`
  - `11100`
  - `101010`
  - `00001011`

### 5. `(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)(a+b)*`
- **Description**: This regular expression matches strings that:
  - Start with exactly five characters, each being either `a` or `b`.
  - Are followed by zero or more additional characters that are either `a` or `b`.
- **Examples**: 
  - `aaaaa`
  - `abbbb`
  - `babaa`
  - `aabbb`
  - `bbbbb`

## How to Use

To test these regular expressions:
1. Enter one of the provided regular expressions into the program.
2. The program will convert and validate the expression, then generate sample strings that match the pattern.
3. Results will be displayed, including any matching strings found within the specified timeout period.

Feel free to modify or expand the regular expressions to suit your needs.
